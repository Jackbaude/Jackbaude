### About 

---

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota, soon to begin my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** (Fall 2025) under **Prof. Zhi-Li Zhang** in the [UMN Networking Lab](https://networking.umn.edu/). My research focuses on **Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs)** and **NextG wireless systems**.

I’m passionate about open-source and next-gen networking—spanning 5G/6G, NTNs like Starlink, and their role in enabling autonomous systems and intelligent infrastructure. I’m also interested in using digital twins to model and optimize complex networked environments
