### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently studying computer science at the University of Minnesota. I am interested in low-level software design in the open source community. I have honed my skills by submitting PRs to open source projects such as the Ockam network. Participating in the UMN CPP has immensely raised my awareness of efficient software design. I am **eager** to make an impact in software and am seeking internship opportunities.
